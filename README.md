# Argyresthia_host_plant_phylo

This repository contains data and code for the stochastic character mapping of host plant data to species of <i>Argyresthia</i>, as well as data examining the differences between maximum likelihood (IQTREE) and Bayesian (MrBayes) inferences, as inferred from a COI tree.

The following files are included:
<p><b>Argyresthia_Host_Plant_Stochastic_Character_Mapping.Rmd</b> - R Markdown file annotated with steps and code taken to conduct stochastic character mapping as well as the comparison of maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches.
<p><b>Argyresthia_Host_Plant_Stochastic_Character_Mapping.pdf</b> - PDF file knit from R Markdown showing code in easily displayable format.
<p><b>Argyresthia_Hosts.csv</b> - Comma-separated values file associating species with host plant information.
<p><b>Argyresthia_output_R1_taxa_removed.phy.contree.tre</b> - Tree inferred from maximum likelihood (IQTREE) analysis.
<p><b>Argyresthia_Bayes_R2.tre</b> - Tree inferred from Bayesian (MrBayes) analysis.
